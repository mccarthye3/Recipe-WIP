        bags of the mexican blend cheese from your local grocery store. I reccommend 
        three if you would like to add extra cheese to bake on top)

<h2> Directions</h2>
<h4>The Taco Meat</h4>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Spray down your frying pan with a generous layer of cooking spray. Put the stove on medium heat. </li>
    <li>Place your hamburger in the pan. Use your spatula to break the hamburger up into small chunks. </li>
    <li>Coat the hamburger in an even layer of adobo abd garlic poweder. Add a gentle sprinkle of chili poweder and kayen peper. There will be more spice in the cheese, so do not over load your meat. Otherwise, you will lose the flavor of the meat.</li>
    <li>Use the spatula to stir the seasoning into meat, and continue to break up the hamburger into fine chunks. </li>
    <li>Cook the hamburger over medium heat until it browns. Continue to flip the meat to cook evenly on all sides. </li>

    <li>Take your flour, and sprinkle into the pan. Stir the flour quickly, until it is an even paste with no bumps. </li>
    <li>Slowly stir in the milk until the mixture becomes thick. If it is not thickening, mix flour in a cup
    with water until you have a thick paste, and pour into the milk mixture. Do so until you achieve your desired thickness. </li>
    <li>Next, add your cheeses. Mix evenly until all the cheese has melted together. At this time, you may also add your packet of taco seasoning, and additional seasoning if you would like your cheese sauce to be spicier. </li>

Combine the pasta, hambuger, and cheese within the large sauce pan. Carefully stir all the contents 
together until well blended. If you would like, you can put your mac n cheese into a baking pan

10 minutes until the cheese is melted. Serve with tomato and green onion as a garnish.
